### 2. Security Strategy


- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC within Power Apps and Azure services to ensure that users can only access the data and functionality necessary for their roles.
- **Data Encryption**: Utilize Azure's built-in encryption capabilities to encrypt data at rest and in transit.
- **Compliance Audits**: Regularly conduct audits to ensure ongoing compliance with GDPR and other relevant regulations.
- **Secure APIs**: Use Azure API Management to secure and manage APIs used by Power Apps and external systems.

### 3. Performance Optimization Plan
Optimizing performance to handle the scale and demand of a city-wide transit system.

- **Load Testing**: Conduct regular load testing to identify potential bottlenecks and stress points in the system.
- **Data Caching**: Implement caching strategies using Azure Redis Cache to improve the responsiveness of the system.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Design the system using Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps to automatically scale based on demand.

### 4. User Adoption Strategy
Maximizing user adoption through effective training and feedback mechanisms.

- **Interactive Training Sessions**: Develop interactive training sessions using Power Pages to educate users on system features.
- **Feedback Loop**: Integrate a feedback module within the Canvas App to collect and analyze user feedback for continuous improvement.
- **Multilingual Support**: Ensure the user interface is available in multiple languages to cater to all city residents.

### 5. Project Management Plan
Using Agile methodologies to manage the project efficiently.

- **Agile Sprints**: Break down the project into two-week sprints, with specific goals and deliverables for each sprint.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Clearly define roles and responsibilities for each team member, ensuring accountability.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Regularly update stakeholders on progress and incorporate their feedback into the project.

### 6. Functional Requirements

1. **Real-Time Vehicle Tracking**
   - System must track the location of all buses and trains in real time and provide this information to both the control center and public-facing apps.

2. **Unified Ticketing System**
   - Implement a unified ticketing system across all transport modes, allowing users to purchase and renew tickets via mobile and web applications.

3. **Automated Alerts for Maintenance**
   - The system should automatically generate maintenance alerts based on vehicle diagnostics and predictive analytics from AI Builder.

4. **Customer Feedback Integration**
   - Integrate a feedback mechanism within the mobile app to collect and analyze customer feedback in real time.

5. **Custom Reporting Tools**
   - Develop custom reporting tools for administrative use that allow for the analysis of operational efficiency, transit usage, and maintenance schedules.

6. **Marketing and Outreach Automation**
   - Automate marketing campaigns and outreach efforts through Dynamics 365, targeting promotions based on user behavior and preferences.

7. **Disaster Recovery Protocols**
   - Implement protocols for data backup and system recovery to ensure service continuity in the event of an outage or disaster.

### 7. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability**
   - The system must be capable of scaling to handle increases in user numbers and data volume without degradation in performance.

2. **Availability**
   - Achieve at least 99.9% uptime for all critical components of the system, ensuring consistent accessibility for users and administrators.

3. **Security**
   - Adhere to industry-standard security practices, including data encryption at rest and in transit, regular security audits, and compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations.

4. **Usability**
   - The user interfaces, both mobile and web, should be intuitive and easy to use for all demographic groups, with support for multiple languages.

5. **Performance**
   - The system should provide responses within 2 seconds for user interactions under normal conditions and handle simultaneous connections of at least 10,000 users.

6. **Maintainability**
   - The system should be designed for easy maintenance and updates, with clear documentation and modular components.

7. **Integration Compatibility**
   - Ensure compatibility and easy integration with existing city infrastructure systems as well as potential future upgrades or systems from other vendors.
